## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- JavaScript
- React
- Vite

### What I learned

This was an extremely fun project to practice my React skills. Along with that, I learned a lot about creating a website that can be navigated via keyboard. This was a new challenge for me, but one I took on happily in an effort to better pracrtice my skills in web accessibility.

### Continued development

Again, this was the perfect project to not only practice my skills in React, but also a perfect introduction to creative a site that can be navigated via keyboard. I would like to take on more projects that allow me to continue to practice these skills.
